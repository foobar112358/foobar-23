Flaw of Greedy Square
=======================

I submitted the original greedy algo and it passed, but I thought should record the exception ones here.

## The Flaw

In some occational cases, eg 12, split into 4 + 4 + 4 is better than the greedy algo solution `9 + 1 + 1 + 1`. Also, a larger number which will have a remainder of 12 in middle steps, will also affected, eg `61 = 49 + 12`, the best answer is 4 as `square(7) + square(2) * 3`.

I have no math solution to resolve this, but only traverse the numbers below 10000 and make a search table for the middle steps. The traverse function is named to `validate` in `solution.py`.

All the exception numbers can be splitted into the multiple unique squares is below.
